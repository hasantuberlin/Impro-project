Integration of heterogeneous data and analytics in the Medical domain

Goal: One of the difficulties encountered in healthcare analytics nowadays, apart from the huge generation and
availability of data, is the heterogeneity of the data [1,2]. In a typical healthcare analytics use case very different types
of structured, semi-structured and not structured at all data should be considered. Examples include Electronic Medi-
cal Records (EMR), Electronic Health Records (EHR), images, medical text reports, time series, etc. The objective of
this project is to study how these heterogeneous data can be integrated into a unified model and system that allows
scalable data analytics and exploration of information. Such a model should facilitate visualization, via a dashboard, of
historical events and signals (time series measurements such as ECG or blood pressure) collected for many patients.
The objective is to make this project as practical as possible, therefore the scenario and data available in one of the
PhysioNet academic challenges in Healthcare will be used: Predicting Acute Hypotensive Episodes, A challenge from
PhysioNet and Computers in Cardiology 2009 [3]. The solution should be scalable so modern distribute data flow sys-
tems, such as Apache Flink, should be considered for processing, as well a time series data base or flexible NoSQL
databases for storing.
